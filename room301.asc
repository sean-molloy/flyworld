MORE NOTES ON CITY SCROLLER:
14/6/2022

use the destination coordinates to scroll the screen, unless the character is stopped.
  disadvantages:
  uneven scrolling as the character is constantly stopping and starting
  character will often not be centered on screen
  using skip walk will mess with it.
  
  but maybe it'll be fine?
  
  i now think that the streets scenes should probably remain at the same scale or 
  at least not change too much that it's immediately noticable.
